# keras_toolbox

Following some online classes (deeplearning.ai, Datacamp) and blogs, I want to build my own library of files  which can be used when necessary. Thus, the concept of this repo is to have building blocks to be able to implement efficiently new models, and models ready-to-use. 

First example, the residual blocks are the building blocks which are repeated within the Resnet50 (found in models.py).
